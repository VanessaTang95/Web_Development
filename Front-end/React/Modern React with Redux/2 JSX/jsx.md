# JSX
---
### Alert before deeper
* Looks similar to HTML, but __it's not HTML__!
* Special dialect of JS
* Browsers don't understand JSX code, we write in JSX, tools turn it into normal JS
* Very Similar in form and function to HTML with a couple differences

### JSX VS HTML differences
* JSX is JS not HTML
* Inline styling have different syntax
* class have different syntax(incase compiler confused with class(JS) and class(html attribute), JSX use `className`)
* JSX can reference JS variables and function

### Things that JSX cannot pass
* Objects are not valid as a react child, so you cannot directly pass a object to something, but you can get the element from that object
