# Statement

## Disclaimer: This project is following the tutorial of [TheCodePro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CPmtIeapMw&list=WL&index=38&t=0s)'s _React JS REST API Tutorial_. And it's only used for study.

#### Study Goals
* One week a project no matter how smaller it is
* Go through with AXIOS instead of Fetch API
* Get better understanding of interaction of React and RESTful
* Build a simple but attractive book library

#### My Contribution
* Since this tutorial only provide the function view of server, I write my own server

#### Problems I Met
* Java has `object.equals()`, while in JS is `_.isEqual()`, be careful about the parameters when check if it's equal

#### Something new I learned about this
* `this.functionname.bind(param)`, the param inside can be `this` `this Object.property`
* when write `proxy` in react app's package.json, when using fetch/axios to interact with server, the app will use `proxy` address as main url(http://localhost:PORT)

#### Inperfection about this app
* Component lack reusability, should divide the who app into several component
